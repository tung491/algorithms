# Algorithm

## About:
- This project includes my code which implements popular algorithms and data structures in Python (3). These could be based on materials of courses I learned (such as [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) of Stanford in Coursera, [Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd256) in Udacity)

## Data Structure:
* [Linked List](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/linked_list.py) (Singly and Doubly linked list)
* [Stack](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/stack.py)
* [Tree](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/tree.py)
* [Heap](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/heap.py)
