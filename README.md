# Algorithm

## About:
- This project includes my code which implement popular algorithms and data structures in Python (3). These could be based on materials of courses I learned (such as Algorithms Specialization of Stanford in Coursera, Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree in Udacity)

## Data Structure:
* [Linked List](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/linked_list.py) (Singly and Doubly linked list)
* [Stack](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/stack.py)
* [Tree](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/tree.py)
* [Heap](https://github.com/tung491/algorithms/blob/master/data_structure/heap.py)
